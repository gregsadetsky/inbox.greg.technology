### thanks

- [code for gmail api interactions](https://github.com/x4nth055/pythoncode-tutorials/tree/master/general/gmail-api) - thanks a ton!!
- thanks to the same author as above for this [incredibly detailed tutorial](https://thepythoncode.com/article/use-gmail-api-in-python)! the steps to setup the gmail api / GCP json token thing are bananas! but just follow the steps, it all works!!
